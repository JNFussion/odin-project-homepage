## Odin project homepage

This project the second part  of the final assigment from [The odin project HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).

It's a recreation of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) homepage.

The main goal of the project is to recreate a webpage using a basic grid-base framework made by myself. You can find the framework [here](https://github.com/JNFussion/css-framework).<br>
Buttons and links don't work.
